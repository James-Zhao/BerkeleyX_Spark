# MAGIC 
# MAGIC # **Using the Course Autograder**
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Grading in this course is a three step process:
# MAGIC * Completing the lab exercises and using the lab notebook's built-in autograder functionality (TestAssert). The built-in autograder provides you with immediate feedback about the correctness of your code.
# MAGIC * Using the autograder notebook to submit a completed lab exercise to the course autograder. The course autograder runs the _exact_ same tests as the built-in notebook autograder. _There is no advantage to submitting to the course autograder until your code passes all built-in tests._
# MAGIC * Submitting the submission ID from the course autograder on the edX course website. Submitting your submission ID on the edX course website will record your score for the assignment.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ** You must complete _all_ three steps to receive a score for a lab assignment. **
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This notebook will show you how to register for the course autograder, prepare a lab notebook for submission to the course autograder, and submit a notebook for grading by the autograder.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can run a cell by pressing "shift-enter", which will compute the current cell and advance to the next cell, or by clicking in a cell and pressing "control-enter", which will compute the current cell and remain in that cell.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### ** Make sure you have completed the Lab 0 notebook before you run this notebook  - this notebook uses libraries that are installed when you complete Lab 0. **
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ** This notebook covers: **
# MAGIC * *Part 1:* Register for the course autograder
# MAGIC * *Part 2:* Save your private token
# MAGIC * *Part 3:* Submit a lab to the course autograder
# MAGIC * *Part 4:* Check the status of the course autograder queue
# MAGIC * *Part 5:* Get your submission ID for submitting on the edX course website
# MAGIC * *Part 6:* Examine the autograder results for your submission

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Now, you can use this notebook to submit a lab to the course autograder, get a list of your lab submissions to the autograder, get details about a specific submission you made, and get the status of the autograder queue.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### ** Part 3: Submit a lab to the course autograder **
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Once you confirm that your lab notebook is passing all tests, you can submit it first to the course autograder and then second to the edX website to receive a grade.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC To perform the steps in Part 3, open two browser tabs: one with your lab notebook, and one with this autograder notebook.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ** Note that you can only submit to the course autograder once every one minute. **
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Every time you submit to the course autograder, you must perform steps (3a), (3b), (3c), and (3d). ##

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ** (3a) Restart your cluster by clicking on the dropdown next to your cluster name and selecting "Restart Cluster" in your LAB notebook(Not this notebook).**
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can do this step in either notebook, since there is one cluster for your notebooks.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC  <img src="http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/submit_restart.png" alt="Drawing" />

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ** (3b) _IN YOUR LAB NOTEBOOK_, click on "Run All" to run all of the cells in your LAB notebook(Not this notebook). **
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC   <img src="http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/submit_runall.png" alt="Drawing" />
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This step will take some time. While the cluster is running all the cells in your lab notebook, you will see the "Stop Execution" button.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC   <img src="http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/stop_execution.png" alt="Drawing" />
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Wait for your cluster to finish running the cells in your lab notebook before proceeding.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ** (3c) Verify that your LAB notebook(Not this notebook) passes as many tests as you can. **
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Most computations should complete within a few seconds unless stated otherwise. As soon as the expression of a cell have been successfully evaluated, you will see one or more "test passed" messages if the cell includes test expressions:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC   <img src="http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/test_passed.png" alt="Drawing" />
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC or just execution time otherwise:

# COMMAND ----------

# Set the published notebook_url (e.g., notebook_url = "https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/....")
notebook_url = <FILL_IN>

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ** (3e) Re-run the AUTOGRADER notebook(This notebook) **
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Because you just restarted your cluster, all of the state of this autograder notebook has been lost. To recover it, all you have to do is to click on "Run All" (just as you did for your Lab notebook) and your cluster will run all the cells.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC  <img src="http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/submit_runall.png" alt="Drawing" />
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This step will finish quickly. While the cluster is running all the cells in your autograder notebook, you will see the "Stop Execution" button.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC   <img src="http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/stop_execution.png" alt="Drawing" />
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Wait for your cluster to finish running the cells in your autograder notebook before proceeding.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Note that it will stop on Step (3f), since you have not set the _lab_ variable yet.

# COMMAND ----------

# Verify that the username is set
try:
  print "Your username is " + username
except NameError:
  assert False, "Your username is not set. Please check that you set your username in the cell at the beginning of the notebook and you exectuted the cell using SHIFT-ENTER."

# COMMAND ----------

# Verify that the private_token is set
try:
  print "Your private token is " + private_token
except NameError:
  assert False, "Your private token is not set. Please check that you: set the private_token in the cell at the beginning of the notebook, removed the comment character (#) before private_token, and you exectuted the cell using SHIFT-ENTER."

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ** (3f) Select the Course Autograder queue **
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC There are three autograder queues, one for each lab assignment in CS105x: **CS105x-lab0** (setup), **CS105x-lab1b**, and **CS105x-lab2**.
# MAGIC Set the *lab* variable to the assignment you are submitting.

# COMMAND ----------

# Set lab variable (e.g., lab = "CS105x-lab0")

client = autograder(username, private_token)
client.submit(lab, notebook_url)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### ** Part 4: Check the status of the course autograder queue **
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC To check the status of the autograder queue, you use **get_queue_status()**.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can re-run the following cell to redisplay the autograder queue status.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC When the queue is empty for you, it means all your submissions have been graded by the autograder and you can proceed to Part 5.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Note:** It will typically take a few minutes before you receive autograder feedback. If you do not receive feedback within one hour, please use the [Piazza discussion group](https://piazza.com/edx_berkeley/summer2016/cs1051x) to contact the TAs for support.

# COMMAND ----------

# Re-run this cell to see the autograder queue status
import json
(result,queue) = client.get_queue_status()
print "Result for get_queue_status(): %s" % result
if (queue == []):
  print "No submissions for %s found in autograder queue. Proceed to Part 5." % username
else:
  # convert result to a Spark DataFrame
  df_queue = sqlContext.jsonRDD(sc.parallelize([json.dumps(item) for item in queue]))
  display(df_queue['submission_timestamp','grading_status','lab','username'])

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### ** Part 5: Get your submission ID for submitting on the edX course website **
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC To record your score for a lab, you need to submit a submission ID on the edX course website. Use **get_submission_list(lab)** to check your autograder results.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * Copy the _submission_id_ that you want to submit for a score.
# MAGIC * On the edX website page for the lab you completing, enter your **username for autograder** and **submission ID for the lab** to receive a score for the assignment on edX.

# COMMAND ----------

else:
  # convert result to a Spark DataFrame
  df_submission_list = sqlContext.jsonRDD(sc.parallelize([json.dumps(item) for item in submission_list]))
  display(df_submission_list['submission_timestamp','grade','submission_id','lab','autograder_results','username'])

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### ** Part 6: Examine the autograder results for your submission **
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can examine the feedback from the autograder using a _submission_id_ and **get_submission_detail(submission_id)**.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * Copy the _submission_id_ that you want to submit for a score.
# MAGIC * On the edX website page for the lab you completing, enter your **username for autograder** and **submission ID for the lab** to receive a score for the assignment on edX.
